# Pytorch AI Dungeon2

A Fork of Nick Walton's [AI Dungeon2](https://github.com/AIDungeon/AIDungeon) and pytorch as a backend. 

Uses prompts and play.py from the [Clover edition](https://github.com/cloveranon/Clover-Edition)

I did this because tensorflow is annoying to compile for my xeon processor an it was actually faster to port the generation code.

No colab yet.

## Changes

- use half precision for smaller model
- use pytorch
