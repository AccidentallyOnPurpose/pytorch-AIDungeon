Your team medic had to find that out the hard way. Oh sure sometimes you'll come across a tribe that's friendly, but most of the time the lizards see you as food. Soft, fleshy pink food that's invading their territory. Which means you usually end up having to torch an entire village.\n\nFuckin' waste of ammo.\n\nOf course if the planet and its inhabitants weren't enough, there's always the other major powers laying claim to the planet. The Krik Collective, the Mazatt Dominion, and the Elojin Alliance have all laid claims to plunder whatever riches this planet may have and that's why you're here: To make sure this planet is plundered by the Terran Empire instead.\n\nThe next Empire supply ship won't be here for a long time, let alone anymore troops.

I\u2019ve read a lot about your species. We have more in common than you might think. Why if it wasn\u2019t for your lack of spots and disgusting hairy body, we could be brothers!\u201d\n\nYour patience has run out, you grab him by his scrawny throat.\n\n\u201cLook you hairless spotty freak, you better start talking before I let my Sergeant blast a big hole in you and that\u2019s AFTER I turn you over to my Indoctrinator who\u2019ll be only to happy to get his hands on the likes of you.\u201d\n\nWell that got his attention, and apparently he does know something of humans because, Indoctrinator widened his eyes a bit. He keeps his cool though.\n\n\u201cSee now you humans know how to instill fear. Not like those idiot Mazatts that were trying to get information from me. I don\u2019t know how those brainless brutes even mastered the wheel, let alone achieve space travel. Anyway, there\u2019s an old Xont building on this planet.\u201d\nNow your eyes widen.\n\u201cWHAT?! Impossible! The Xont are a myth!

If you found this Xont building, why didn\u2019t you and your team make off with the stuff already? And don\u2019t tell me that you were ambushed by the Mazatt because if you had been, they would\u2019ve taken your findings, OR if the technology was as powerful as everyone claims, you would\u2019ve been able to destroy them with it. Sounds like typical Elojin shit to me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHa ha ha! Who said I had a team? You see, unlike the rest of you galaxy conquerors we Elojin don\u2019t feel the need to send an army to scout a planet, when one or two of us can accomplish the same thing when deployed in strategic areas.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, so there are more of you here.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps. It wouldn\u2019t matter though since we\u2019re deployed in completely separate parts of a planet, even if we were all together, we wouldn\u2019t be able to stand up to a force the size of yours.\u201d\n\u201cThat brings me to the next question, if you found this building already, how come you just didn\u2019t stay there? What the hell do you need us for?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cExcellent question. Well there are some rather nasty things lurking in there. Much too powerful for me, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have no problem dealing with them. I didn\u2019t get too far without them chasing me out. I even tried recruiting a nearby tribe of those silly little reptile creatures to use as cannon fodder, but they refused to go in. From what I can gather they consider the place to be haunted and seem to hold the place in awe and fear. I suppose I should\u2019ve known better to ask the Mazatt for help when I discovered their encampment, but I figured they\u2019d at least listen to reason. Things seem to work out though; your blue concubine came in with full guns blazing and brought me back here.\u201d\n\u201cOkay last question, what proof do you have that it\u2019s a Xont structure, and not just ruins of some other alien species.\u201d\n\u201cThis!\u201d The Elojin quickly pulls out some weird coins out of his pocket and puts them on the table.\n\u201cThe Mazatt never even took these from me. Idiots. These are genuine Xont coins though! The metal is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen on this anywhere else, let alone this planet. It\u2019s obviously not from here. The writing on it looks similar to what many stories have described. And this symbol. Tentacles wrapped around a planet. This is supposed to be what the Xont emblem was.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, a writhing mass of tentacles. I\u2019ve heard that description too. Several of them. Proves nothing.\u201d\n\u201cBut this is the closest anyone\u2019s come to finding something directly relating to the stories! One of the more common stories I might add! Look we Elojin have done the most research in this than anyone, and I\u2019m convinced what I\u2019ve seen IS a Xont building!\u201d\n\nWell it might all be a lie, but he certainly looks convinced, and you have to admit you are a bit curious now.

You can\u2019t be serious! Assuming all this bullshit is real, and we get through all this alive, what makes you think we\u2019d give anything that might benefit you?\u201d\n\u201cBut we have a partnership.

Think of it this way, you owe us for saving your life from the Mazatt, and this is your payment.\u201d\nThe Elojin, looks at you for awhile in silence before speaking again.\n\u201cVery well, it would appear that I have no choice, but surely since I found this place and leading you there, I should get something out of it.\u201d\n\u201cWell you got those coins.

You will be under guard at all times and any attempt to escape will be frowned upon with excessive force. Understand me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d The Elojin says obediently. You can\u2019t help but to think he\u2019s going to try to betray you at some point, and in this case he\u2019d have good reason to do so, but you\u2019ll have to worry about that later.\n\nYou and the Elojin exit your quarters and you address your team. Alyssa verbally tells the more unruly ones to shut up.\n\n\u201cAlright team, we\u2019re finally going to do something worthwhile on this planet, we\u2019re going on a treasure hunt of sorts, guided by this spotty freak here. He\u2019s claiming there\u2019s a Xont structure here, yes the Xont, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard the legends over and over, and while it might just be Elojin bullshit, we don\u2019t have anything better to do, so we might as we check it out. And if he\u2019s lying we\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s the first one to die if he\u2019s trying to lead us into a trap.\u201d\n\nMost of the team looks a bit hesitant. Alyssa is stoic as always, but you can tell she\u2019s not entirely happy about this idea. They\u2019ll follow you though. A few of the lizards heard the word \u201cXont\u201d and went running back into their huts, seems they aren\u2019t the only ones you scared, since LeFleur looks down right petrified. Finally you get the predictable reaction from Salo.\n\n\u201cWHAT!?!! Captain I\u2019ve held my tongue for too long about your liberal views on aliens, but now I must speak! You are treading the dangerous road of heresy by consorting with Elojin trash! Their types are nothing but liars and deceivers and you would allow one to guide us to who knows where?

Look I don\u2019t trust the sonofabitch either, but if we got a chance at finding this Xont building\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLIES! And so what if it is true? The Xont were an alien race that raped countless worlds, and fell due to their decadence! What use has the Terran Empire have for the ruins of an utterly evil civilization?\u201d\n\nWhile Salo is strong in his convictions about hating to work with aliens, you know he also can\u2019t pass up the opportunity to kill more of them. You decide to appeal to that side of him.\n\n\u201cWell think about the technology could be used to help humanity fight its enemies. The Xont as you say subjugated many worlds, and they did it with minimal effort. Perhaps we\u2019ll find something that could destroy those who would oppose us instantly.

We could possibly bring in a new Golden Age of Humanity!\u201d\n\nSalo\u2019s eyes start to glaze over as he takes your words into consideration, he then lowers his weapon. You then whisper to him.\n\u201cWe can always kill the Elojin when he isn\u2019t useful anymore.\u201d\nSalo seems to REALLY like that idea, and agrees to your plan. He still has to get the last word in though.\n\u201cVery well, we\u2019ll do things your way, you are my Captain and I will follow you, but if I see this expedition not following the best interests of the Empire I WILL step in.\u201d\n\nSalo goes and prepares himself for the journey ahead and Alyssa tells everyone else to do the same, since LeFleur apparently went and hid in a tent while this \u201cshowdown\u201d happened.\n\nSoon the team is all packed and ready to go; the Lizards seem to be happy to see you to leave, especially with the mention of the Xont.

A pulse blast hits your chest, and you fall immediately to the ground. Alyssa, who was following close behind, sees you fall and comes out with guns blazing making quick work of the Elojin bushwhackers.\n\nAlyssa attempts to help you, but it\u2019s too late. Before you die, you smile and tell her that you\u2019re sorry, she doesn\u2019t show it, but you can tell she forgives you. She didn\u2019t like how you transformed though. The legacy of the Xont didn\u2019t help you at all, the mere thought consumed you and Alyssa sees that only bad can come if anyone gets a hold of whatever may lay inside.\n\nBeing the survivor she is, Alyssa makes her way back to the Lizard village that you so recently turned into a graveyard, and spends the rest of her stay there. She makes short distanced explorations to break up the monotony, but never ventures back to the Xont structure. When the Empire supply ship comes she is taken back and reports that the planet has diseases that wreak havoc on the humans, thus the reason why she\u2019s the only survivor and there\u2019s nothing of value on the planet. She continues with her lie that the Elojin were trying to use it as a base, she then suggests that the planet be bombarded with mass drivers so at least they can\u2019t use it.

Maybe the Sentinels will think we\u2019re just a harmless subject race of the Xont\u201d\n\u201cSo what do we do to look harmless?\u201d\n\u201cDrop all our guns.\u201d\n\nEveryone isn\u2019t too enthusiastic about that idea! However, it sounds somewhat plausible. Scientists aren\u2019t usually known for their combat abilities and they probably weren\u2019t running around with guns because of the Sentinels, and thus weren\u2019t considered a threat. You can only hope the Sentinels still don\u2019t perceive you as a threat even without guns. Alyssa is particularly skilled in unarmed combat.\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it. It might be our only chance.

You feel slightly bad about LaFleur\u2019s needless death, so you propose that it be mentioned that he died valiantly against the Elojin who had ambushed him. Salo\u2019s death will also be attributed to the Elojin.\n\nThe rest of the time goes by without incident, you basically stay in the village until the Empire ship comes, at which point you tell your story. Considering you blame everything on the Elojin, your story really isn\u2019t questioned. The Empire never needs that much of an excuse to bombard entire planets with mass drivers, so the Xont structure along with everything else on the planet is destroyed.

Apparently they figured you all would get killed inside and they\u2019d pick up the pieces.\n\nReaching the village your team looks relieved to see you come back. You take the opportunity to say a few words.\n\n\u201cAlright team, all of us and me especially were under some fucked up influence, not sure what it was, but it wasn\u2019t good. Now there was a lot of stuff done, that doesn\u2019t need to be reported, so I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re all willing to back me up on the story.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re with you sir.\u201d one of them pipes up.\n\u201cWe always will be.\u201d Alyssa adds.\n\u201cAlright this is what we\u2019re going to do\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen the Empire ships arrive, you explain a story about Paradise being a hostile world holding only death. You feel bad about LaFleur\u2019s needless death so you also add that he died bravely in combat and should be posthumously rewarded. You also say the Elojin were attempting to use the place as a secret spy training camp, and state that mass driver bombardment of the planet should be in order. Your superiors have no reason to disbelieve you, and take your advice. Paradise is laid to waste and the Xont structure will never be discovered. You\u2019re sent on your next mission where replacements will meet you.\n\nOn your way there, Alyssa as approaches you.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it Captain? Why didn\u2019t you reveal the Xont structure? You might\u2019ve gotten promoted or even better, assigned to a different command.\n\n\u201cBecause it would\u2019ve just made things worse. The Empire\u2019s survived this long, it\u2019s not going to fall anytime soon. I\u2019d rather live with the way things are, than risk an uncertain future. Besides I don\u2019t want to leave you anymore than you want to leave me.\u201d\n\nAlyssa smiles at this comment, a rarity that you wish she\u2019d do more often.\n\nOf course in time you do see it a lot more.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Listen to Dobbs", "result": "You decide to listen to Private Dobbs, exploring this place probably isn\u2019t the safest thing to do given that you\u2019ve only just shaken the weird mind control you were experiencing earlier.

Looks like your team won, you guess the Elojin were hoping you\u2019d be easy pickings after coming out of the place.\n\nWhen you get to the Lizard village the rest of the team looks relieved to see you. You all exchange information. You\u2019re unsure what to do about the Xont structure though, you\u2019re tempted to go back in, but you decide that you should probably just stick around and just report your findings to the Empire which can send in a better prepared team. In the mean time, you spend the rest of your stay at the Lizard village. It\u2019s uneventful until one day Dobbs comes up missing for roll call, this is followed by a huge explosion later during a search for him. The shockwave of it, makes you almost think you\u2019re being bombarded from above, but after it dies down you realize it was the Xont structure.\n\nYou and your team immediately head over to where it stood and it is completely gone. Nothing but a gigantic crater exists. Whatever useful information it contained will remain a mystery.\n\nThe disappearance of Dobbs makes you come to the conclusion of either one of two things, either he was under the influence of something that didn\u2019t want you uncover any Xont secrets and he snuck off to activate some sort of self-destruct mechanism. Or less likely, he wasn\u2019t under any influence, but decided that for the good of the Empire, the Xont structure needed to be destroyed so it couldn\u2019t possibly cause any trouble like it did with you and your team.\n\nWhen the Empire ship arrives you decide to leave out the whole incident with the Xont structure, your superiors would only be mad at you for losing such a find. You report that you suffered casualties with Elojin and native forces. You also add that Private Dobbs should be honored post humorously for his bravery in battle. Finally you go on to report you didn\u2019t find anything of any use for the Empire on the planet.\n\nYour superiors nod and dismiss you. They write Paradise off as a low priority and not worth colonizing or even keeping an outpost on. Eventually you\u2019re sent on your next mission, which is far away from Paradise.

I told them that they should take special precautions with the new germ weapon they were working on, but do they listen? No!

The Xont have long since disappeared. And up until now, they were considered a legend of some sort.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cOh I assure you they were very real.

After this unexpected attack, the hologram speaks once again.\n\n\u201cWell I guess the Xont would\u2019ve considered that a successful result of their experiment.\u201d\n\u201cOkay what the hell were Xont working on here and what do you mean by success?\u201d you demand.\n\u201cOh they were working on many things actually, but they were doing a lot of research on mind control, and how it could best be implemented. The germ weapon I referred to earlier was one of their experiments. It was designed to infect other races with the \u201cXont way of thinking.\u201d so they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about rebellions cropping up on the worlds they conquered. What a spectacular failure that was\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMy team came in here and some of us felt strange, myself especially, but we seemed to have shaken the feeling. And while I felt a lot more hostile, but I didn\u2019t feel like a servant of the Xont.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell, I just said it was a spectacular failure! The problem with germs is they\u2019re unpredictable and always changing! One might affect one person one way, might affect another very differently! Now take hundreds of different races into the equation and you have a recipe for disaster! I told them they should stick with technology; little obedience chips in the currency. Everyone likes money, everyone uses it and Xont currency was wide spread throughout the galaxy.\u201d\n\u201cI think we came across some of those coins.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh really? Well I\u2019m sure the effect on you was minimal. I never got the chance to perfect them considering the idea was shot down before I could really get the project started! I only made a few test prototypes, and those were distanced linked to a power source in this facility. So I imagine they only started affecting you until you started getting closer to this place. You wouldn\u2019t happen to have them still would you?\u201d\n\u201cNo I destroyed them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! Well I can see my work isn\u2019t appreciated today either!

Why I think you\u2019re the first person who\u2019s ever asked about me. This is a real special occasion. I\u2019m a hologram of course, but it\u2019s obvious that I\u2019m not a common one. I actually existed at one time or rather my race did until the Xont exterminated us. I am actually the collective representation of what remains of the Gequek civilization. We were primarily a scholarly and relatively peaceful race. In fact we were the ones who made first contact with the Xont and gave them the ability to travel the stars, a decision that obviously came back to haunt us. They started out nice enough, but something within them changed. When we learned that the Xont were intent on galactic conquest we refused to contribute anymore technology to their war machine, but by then it was too late, they attacked in force and completely conquered us. They saw us as a threat to their rule yet they still desired our knowledge. After bleeding our learning centers and our best minds dry of everything, they created this hologram to hold the data. I\u2019m still not sure why they just didn\u2019t download the information in their own databases instead of going through the elaborate process of making a complex hologram of a race that they were intent on destroying. Perhaps they saw us as a \u201cparent\u201d of some sort. After all we had given them everything. And even though they had the need to destroy us, they couldn\u2019t bear thought of us being gone forever. Whatever their reasons, after I was created and online, the last Gequek were exterminated.\u201d\n\u201cSo are you sentient, or just an elaborate program?\u201d\n\u201cGood question. I started out as just an elaborate program, I was taken from research center to research center assisting on projects for the Xont, and providing statistics, opinions and theories, but as time went on, I began to develop a sense of \u201cself\u201d. Unsurprisingly I began to display many Gequek traits which infuriated the Xont. They didn\u2019t want to risk deprogramming me and disseminating the information in a more traditional way at that point though. They just learned to put up with me.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you want revenge though?\u201d\n\u201cFor what? I mean yes the Gequek spirit lived on within me, but what purpose would\u2019ve been gained by revenge? If I became hostile, the Xont would\u2019ve destroyed me regardless of the loss to them and if I ceased to exist then so would the Gequek, I couldn\u2019t let that happen. In my current service to the Xont, I was essentially immortal; I was well protected. My expertise was sought and I was grudgingly respected and my new found sentience was a constant source of irritation to them. The Xont are all gone and I\u2019m still here so perhaps the Gequek did get revenge even if it was a little late.\u201d", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "Ask about the outbreak and germ weapon", "result": "\u201cAs I stated the Xont were working on a germ weapon to make others obedient to them. I guess it wasn\u2019t so much of a weapon, as a reinforcer to those they had already enslaved. They really needed it too, at that point rebellions were becoming a big problem and they couldn\u2019t just resort to mass genocide, as they had become too reliant on their slaves. The idea was to create a virus with Xont DNA. They thought by infecting others with \u201cthemselves\u201d that it would cause them to be more willing to serve.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a scientist, but that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d\n\u201cOh the virus was a lot more complex than that, but that was the basic premise. Still, you\u2019re right, there wasn\u2019t any evidence that it would work. Oh sure they did some tests that were successful, but they had done just as many that weren\u2019t. They brought me here to help, and they really didn\u2019t want to hear me telling them that the virus would never work the way they wanted it to. I told them they were making a lot of assumptions and were biasing their testing which really isn\u2019t a good idea, if you\u2019re making a virus weapon. Only when there was an accident in one of the labs did they see I was right.\u201d\n\u201cSo what happened?\u201d\n\u201cWell before they unceremoniously switched me offline, I got to see first hand what the virus did. When the vials were broken, they should\u2019ve evacuated the place then, but they were convinced that the virus wouldn\u2019t have any effect on them, so it was treated like a minor mishap. A few days later it was pretty apparent that was the wrong way to go about it. The Xont scientists here started acting more aggressively, paranoid, and downright nasty. And keep in mind these were traits that most of them already exhibited, so these traits were increased ten fold. The other servant races here started acting the same way; some weren\u2019t the loyal little slaves the virus was supposed to make them though. The air was ripe with rebellion, and soon everyone started killing each other. Xont were even killing other Xont, a few non-affected tried to send a distress call to the nearest military detachment to end this madness that had taken over the facility, I was going to go for a more direct approach and activate the Silver Sentinels, but then someone switched me offline, and I\u2019ve been that way until just now.\u201d\n\u201cHow come it didn\u2019t affect some? And how is it still affecting people after all this time has passed?!\u201d\n\u201cLike I said, viruses aren\u2019t certain. They mutate, and some people just have strong constitutions, so some won\u2019t be affected at all, while others have severe reactions. For those affected, the only common thing that I saw the virus do was increase aggressiveness. It didn\u2019t necessarily make one loyal to the Xont or anything else for that matter. As for why it\u2019s still around after all this time, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s obviously airborne, but I would\u2019ve thought it would\u2019ve died out by now as well too. Something is still carrying it\u2026 that dead Daklow in the doorway, didn\u2019t you just kill it?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that tentacled thing? Yeah.\u201d\n\u201cThose creatures were designed to be strong physically, and very resilient, it\u2019s quite possible that they are carriers and aren\u2019t affected, of course you\u2019d never know since they were bred to attack almost anything on sight. Anyway if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d say anyone coming in here runs a risk of being infected, who in turn could infect others.\u201d\n\u201cWell how the hell are those things still alive though, if they were created eons ago?\u201d\n\u201cUh, my guess would be they MATED with each other, thus producing generations of offspring and those aren\u2019t same ones! Sheesh! Think man! It\u2019s a good thing they have a strong sense of territory, that\u2019s probably why they haven\u2019t overrun the planet; they tend to stick near the place that they were designed to guard.\u201d\n\u201cSo what do you think happened after you were shut down?\u201d\n\u201cOh I imagine someone escaped, maybe several people and ended up spreading the damn virus to other planets, causing more strife in an already volatile situation that the Xont were in, which caused a predictable domino effect.

The Xont always liked building underground rather than up. I\u2019d be careful if you decide to go down there, it could be completely safe, but they were doing some secret experiments that even I wasn\u2019t allowed to know about, so who knows what\u2019s still lingering down there.

No doubt to gain an advantage over your enemies and rule the galaxy. Time may have passed, but I know some things never change.\u201d\n\u201cIf you think that, why help us?\u201d\n\u201cA sense of being useful? Purpose? Perhaps I\u2019ve grown too cynical to care, but it\u2019s better than being stuck here. I had to put up with the Xont for centuries. Your race cannot possibly be worse.

I don\u2019t understand though, I thought you\u2019d want all the technology for your government.\u201d\n\u201cPart of me does, but the other part thinks it\u2019s a bad idea. Some of the things you said hit home too. The Xont became power mad dictators and eventually fell due to their own arrogance. I see that all too likely to happen given the history of humanity.\u201d\nThe Hologram smiles.\n\n\u201cIf you even considered that, then there already is more hope for your race than you think. A typical Xont, would\u2019ve been GIMME GIMME GIMME! Very well, but why keep me? Even though I consider myself sentient, I would surely fit under Xont technology.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m still human, I can\u2019t leave with nothing! Besides you are alive and you should be allowed to live. You hold the knowledge of the Xont but you could dish it out in small bites as it were. Give us only what you think we\u2019re ready for.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha ha! Wouldn\u2019t that make ME a kind of god? Though I do like the sound of it, so what you\u2019re suggesting is that I guide your scientists and leaders so they use the knowledge for more beneficial ends and not necessarily just for the traditional kill, crush and destroy ideology that everyone seems to favor.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you think you could do it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, they might just get sick of me and erase me.\u201d\n\u201cHey you said you evaded that fate from the Xont for centuries and they were already in control of the galaxy. Humanity can\u2019t stand a mystery, if there\u2019s something they even THINK you\u2019re holding back, trust me, you\u2019ll be kept alive.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, your race sounds more interesting the more you tell me, I don\u2019t think you could persuade me not to do it now. Okay here\u2019s how to set the sequence, now listen carefully\u2026\u201d\n\nAfter downloading the Hologram, you set the sequence and run as fast as possible, you and Alyssa get out, passing the bodies of some Elojin who must\u2019ve been attempting to ambush your team. An explosion follows and you and Alyssa dive for cover. Soon some of your team comes to meet the both of you.\n\n\u201cSir what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll soon see.\u201d You say looking at the holo-emitter.\n\nWhen the Empire ships arrive you give a story that doesn\u2019t explain exactly everything, but then they don\u2019t need to know. You leave out the Xont, and mind control. You say Salo died in a Lizard ambush, and feeling slightly bad about LaFleur\u2019s death, you say he died bravely in combat and should be rewarded posthumously. Ultimately you tell them you found the holo-emitter in some non-descript cave. Your superiors are satisfied with your story and take the emitter. They write Paradise off as low priority and send you on your next mission. You and Alyssa grow a little closer due to the events that occurred on Paradise, realizing you should take advantage of the situation you both pursue a \u201csecret relationship\u201d, your team knows, but without an Indoctrinator looking over your shoulder; it\u2019s not really given a second thought.\n\nBut this is not the end\u2026\n\nThe Empire leaders aren\u2019t pleased at first with the Hologram\u2019s \u201cteaspoon\u201d feeding of knowledge, but they learn to deal with it. It proves to be beneficial; the Empire grows stronger without going overboard. The Hologram remembering the mistakes that were made with the Xont tries to guide humanity towards a more \u201cenlightened path\u201d he isn\u2019t entirely successful, but some restrictions are loosened up, and the Indoctrinator Order is weakened a bit.

You and your team got temporarily infected by some virus weapon by a race long since dead, not to mention fighting their \u201cpets\u201d and you\u2019re still possibly in danger being in this contaminated facility.

I think I remembered what some of these symbols were supposed to mean, I think I can figured out how we can turn them on without them attacking us. I remember a Xont legend about \u201cSilver Sentinels\u201d, and that\u2019s what these things look like. I guess they were created by the Xont primarily to act as guards for scientists, if we don\u2019t look like a threat then they shouldn\u2019t attack us.

Soon the battle moves far enough from the doorway, and you can hear the Sentinels hunting down the rest of the abominations.

When the pick up ship comes you\u2019ll report your findings.\n\nIn the mean time you tell your team to pick up their weapons, head for the exit as quickly as possible and spend the rest of your time here back at the Lizard village nearby. When you get outside you\u2019re ambushed by a small Elojin team, but they aren\u2019t any match for you, the cowards run as soon as they realize they\u2019re outnumbered. Their running doesn\u2019t help them, Salo takes special care to shoot crippling shots, rather than outright killing them, he then takes special delight of dragging them back to the Lizard village to extract more information out of them.

Good. I was tired of talking with natives, let alone my fellow Elojin. I swear we can\u2019t agree on anything.

Gather up the team, we\u2019re heading out.\u201d\n\nYou and Alyssa leave the tent while she calls everyone to gather around. She has such a strong commanding presence. You never realized how alluring that was.\n\n\u201cAlright team, thanks to our recently departed spotty friend, he has provided us with the location of a genuine Xont structure. Yes, the mythical Xont, but I have proof that it exists and the directions! Besides we were put on here to explore this forsaken planet anyway, so we might as well check it out. Who\u2019s with me?\u201d\n\nYour team looks a little unsure, but they trust you. Alyssa looks stoic as usual, but a slight twinge of apprehensiveness crosses her face, but you\u2019ll make her see that this was a good idea. LaFleur looks craven, but typically is too scared to voice his opinion. Finally you hear the voice of dissention.\n\n\u201cCaptain, how can we trust what that alien scum told you? The Elojin are notorious liars!\u201d\n\u201cAh, but I have proof!\u201d you hold up the coins. \u201cSee the Elojin thought he was going to trick us and use us but instead I have taken the advantage! We won\u2019t be sharing this find with anyone, but us!\u201d\nSalo gives you a suspicious look. He doesn\u2019t mind that you wasted the Elojin, but he\u2019s a little disturbed by this new found excitement.\n\n\u201cVery well, I suppose our duty to the Empire is to explore this planet, but I fail to see how the archaic ruins of some alien civilization which may not exist will benefit it.\u201d\n\nYou dismiss Salo\u2019s xenophobia, and get ready to leave. The Lizards have been overhearing parts of your conversation, and have also gotten agitated every time the word \u201cXont\u201d was mentioned. They don\u2019t attack, but it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019ve worn out your welcome.\n\nYou and your team leave for the jungle, after some time later, you reach a river. You make camp for the night, telling everyone that it\u2019ll be faster to actually travel on the river, so tomorrow a raft of sorts is going to be made. There\u2019s certainly no shortage of trees.

We went through the usual motions, until we encountered these natives. Of course as you probably know, they\u2019re mostly hostile, but somehow I sensed a certain honor in these scaly natives. They are like the Mazatt. A race of warriors, and they\u2019re completely trustworthy unlike all the other races we\u2019ve encountered. Yes, they were primitive, but they do not deserve enslavement. I wanted to try to do something new, make peace with them and perhaps eventually incorporate them into the Dominion, but not as a slave race.\u201d\n\nInteresting point of view for a Mazatt, the Empire of course does this when possible, but the Dominion never does.

They thought me dead I suppose, but I was not out of it yet. Even with my head bad head wound I struggled to get up and I crawled inside a nearby cave, and that\u2019s when destiny found me, and I found THIS!\n\nThe Mazatt brandishes a coin! One exactly like the ones you obtained from the Elojin.\n\n\u201cI knew what it was; I had heard the legends of the Xont before. I never paid too much attention to them before, but somehow I knew this was real. I just had to find the ruins of the Xont, but then I fell into unconsciousness. That\u2019s when the scalies found me. The fact they never ate me and brought me back to full health only confirmed that I had been spared for something greater.

If you really thought you were the chosen one, you would\u2019ve killed me right away as either an imposter or a threat. But no, you wanted me to convince you, because deep down, you don\u2019t even believe you\u2019ve been chosen.

Higgins reports that they miss Kruz and felt he was a better leader. This news makes you furious! You proved yourself to be better than that pretender! This irritation only grows as time passes. Days pass and the Xont structure still hasn\u2019t been found, and worse, other surrounding Lizard tribes have been attacking despite attempts to make alliances. Old fashioned conquest works, but the Lizards constantly resist and just don\u2019t have the man power to keep your holdings even through fear. Eventually the Lizard tribes do start uniting\u2026against YOU.\n\nA coalition of tribes marches on your position, and while your Lizards are definitely more organized, better trained and better equipped, you\u2019re severely out numbered.

A fleeting thought crosses your mind in your last moments of life, you never actually found these coins, you stole them from the Elojin who found them.\n\n\u201cDestiny\u2026 didn\u2019t choose\u2026 me.\u201d", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Spare him", "result": "\u201cGet up, you shall follow me.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo I am not going to kill you, perhaps you were not chosen, but I still see use for you.\u201d\n\nYou immediately take control of the village and order for the search of the Xont structure. Your team gets a much needed break and spends most of its time in the village, now that you have Lizards to do the searching. Your new command consists of Alyssa, LaFleur, Higgins and Kruz who turns out to be very helpful and the most enthusiastic of your followers. Diplomatic missions to other Lizard villages are accomplished while others are conquered. New Lizard troops are trained immediately; soon you have a REAL army. Still, you haven\u2019t found the Xont structure, but it hardly matters, you are accomplishing your destiny even without the technology, you just can\u2019t wait for the day that you find it, your power will increase tenfold.\n\nEveryone is pretty much behind you, and is enthusiastic about your goal. Only Alyssa seems troubled the entire time. You almost think that she won\u2019t become your wife, but she accepts.

You refuse to run though; you have a destiny to crush the Empire.\n\nBut as the ship explodes and your followers die around you, you finally have a moment of clarity:\n\nThere was never any way you could fight the Empire.

Don\u2019t worry about it, the Elojin was probably talking bullshit anyway about the Xont, we all know that\u2019s just a myth.
