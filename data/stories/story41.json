The gun went off, and it was luckily not yourself on the receiving end. You kneel beside him, breathing heavily. He is dead. Searching him, you find a wallet, six passports, but no police papers or badge. He also has a thick brown envelope full of local currency, and taped to it, a small numbered key.\n\nYou browse the wallet, and to your surprise, you find it does not belong to the dead man.

Perhaps the number on the key is the box that it unlocks.\n\nYou look at the dropped gun for a while, wondering if you should take it with you or not.

Something tells you that he would not have left her alive.\n\nWhere to now, you wonder? You have an envelope full of cash. Perhaps you should follow the trail left by the bull and the ticket. Perhaps if you took it to London, following the ticket, you might find more answers. Perhaps there was an antique dealer in London?

Both Adonica and yourself were clearly involved in the scheme somehow, but why then was Adonica killed, and why were you such a threat to them?\n\nHad you both tried to blackmail them, betray them, or were you undercover cops trying to expose them?
