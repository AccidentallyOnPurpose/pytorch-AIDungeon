The tired beast lets out a massive snort. You lean forward in the saddle and scratch just behind its antlers.\n\n\n    \u201cGood beast,\u201d you murmur. You give it a kiss, right in its furry mane. \u201cNot too further boy, promise.\u201d\n\n\n    The beast comes to a stop. It stands on the edge of the snowy, switchback trail that you\u2019d been following for weeks. Beyond mountain, lies nothing but thick, snow-covered forest. You let out a sigh of relief. You\u2019ve found the spring hunting grounds.\n\n\n    You\u2019ve ridden ahead of the rest of the tribe, searching for this very forest. While they make the difficult trek over the mountain (exacerbated by the presence of women, children, and the elderly), you\u2019ve ridden ahead in search for a camp sight for the tribe.\n\n\n    You drive your heels into its sides, and the beast begins to carefully plod down the mountainside. It stops only once, to leave a steaming pile of manure in the snow.\n\n\n    You wince as you hop out of the saddle, and the drop to the ground sends a jolt through your body. Taking a moment, you briefly insure that your spear and satchel of provisions are still on your back. Satisfied, you drop the reigns over the Elken\u2019s head, and lead him into the forest\u2026\n\n\n***\n\n\n    The clearing is in the same spot it's in every year. You know from experience that it can easily house the entire tribe and their huts; the Gods certainly know that this unusually harsh winter has not grown the tribe.\n\n\n    It takes a hours to find dry wood for the signal pyre. Eventually, you assemble a pyramid of dead wood and dry brush and set it ablaze with your flint and knife. The flames lick greedily at the cold winter air, and a thick, black plume of smoke reaches up in to the sky.", "action_results": [{"action": "The tribe arrives", "result": "    On the fifth day, the tribe arrives. Being the advance scout, you have the honour of setting your tent up first. You unrolled the furs that you stored on the Elken\u2019s back, and strung them over a framework of thick branches. The tent will be able to house five or six of your tribe, easily. You leave a hole at the top to let the smoke from the life-saving fire out.\n\n\n    You\u2019re standing in the middle of the clearing, cleaning the Elken with a coarse horsehair brush when the rest of your tribe approaches.\n\n\n    Some are walking, some are riding Elken. Mothers clutch their babes to their breasts, while fathers look cautiously to the woods; Fell Bears and wolf-packs have been known to hunt these woods. Disturbingly, gangs of legionnaires have also been stalking the woods. Those taken are presumably fed to whatever foreign gods lord over the Marble City.\n\n\n    Caelan, the most elderly man of the tribe, and the chieftain since before you were born, spots you immediately. A youthful grin splits open his aged face. He shivers in the cold, and lets out a cloud of smoke from his mouth, which rapidly dissipates in the frigid winter air. The old man wraps his fur cloak around him.\n\n\n    \u201cYou\u2019ve done well by the tribe,\u201d he says, as he approaches, \u201cYour father would be proud.\u201d\n\n\n    You dip your head in gratitude.\n\n\n    He presses his middle, index, and ring fingers into your forehead. \u201cI release you from your duties as Torchbearer.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Caelan.\u201d you say as you press your forehead into his \u2014 a salute as old as time.\n\n\n    \u201cYou as well, my boy.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cHow was the journey?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cIt was hard. The old paths were snowier than usual, there were some who thought you\u2019d died, and we wouldn\u2019t have a camp-sight to come to.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cStill alive,\u201d you say with a smile.\n\n\n    \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad to see it. Still, I shouldn\u2019t complain too much about the journey. We only lost one, this year.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cWho was that?\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cWaiola. Tacitus\u2019 newborn daughter. The cold was too much for her.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cThat\u2019s a shame. His first child, yeah?\u201d\n\n\n    He nods, and gives you a wan smile. \u201cHe\u2019s been taking it hard. When you see him around, be kind to him and his wife.\u201d\n\n\n    You fall silent for a moment. Before you can speak, another approaches. Wrapped in furs with a bow strung across her back. She\u2019s missing her left ear, and there are scars running from the tips of her mouth up her cheek by a few inches. Even still, she\u2019s wearing a broad smile across her face.\n\n\n    \u201cYou\u2019re the Torchbearer?\u201d she asks jovially.\n\n\n    You glance at Caelan in confusion.\n\n\n    \u201cThis is Enya. She\u2019s a tribe-less we picked up on the journey; didn\u2019t feel right to abandon her.\u201d\n\n\n    \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d you agree, before turning back to Enya and extending your hand.  She takes it; her grip is firm.\n\n\n    She purses her lips and nods as you shake hands. \u201cI\u2019m glad you feel that way.\u201d\n\n\n    You snort.\n\n\n    \u201cI\u2019m fucking tired,\u201d Caelan says frankly, \u201cwe should see to setting up those tents.\u201d\n\n\n    And so you do, for the rest of the day. All of the tribe works together erecting the massive  tents that will be their home for the coming months. Thick frameworks are nailed in place, and cured hides are set on the floor so as to avoid sleeping on the snow. Furs are strung from the oak frameworks to trap in heat and act as walls. Firepits in the centres are also constructed, for cooking and boiling water.

She\u2019s sitting cross-legged on a large rock, scraping a piece of flint over a bone knife.\n\n\n    \u201cMorning,\u201d you say. You eye her with a slight amount of caution.\n\n\n    She returns the greeting, not looking up from the knife.\n\n\n    \u201cPlanning on going out for a hunt?\u201d  you ask.\n\n\n    \u201cAye.

You become one with the forest, once more; a spectre, silently moving over roots, branches and patches of grass. A finder of secret paths and animal tracks.\n\n\n    Perhaps you\u2019re there for minutes. Perhaps you\u2019re there for hours, days, or weeks. Time is ephemeral and meaningless when you\u2019re in the forest. Soon, you find a handsome buck; skittish, along with all of its kind.\n\n\n    Over hours, you learn the animal\u2019s personality. He\u2019s cautious and smart, and will be a challenge to bring down. You don\u2019t even knock an arrow until your second encounter with him. Finally, on the fourth meeting, you manage to creep up on him unawares.\n\n\n    You see his hot breath evaporating in the winter air. You become aware of his place relative to yours on the food chain. You are hunter, and he is prey; this is the way things ought to be.\n\n\n    You let go of the bowstring.\n\n\n    The arrow flies true, and the bolt tears right through the deer\u2019s vitals. It stumbles for a few paces, before falling face-first into the snow. A crimson puddle seeps out from under him as he breathes his last.\n\n\n    You feel a twinge of guilt as you approach him. You slit the deer\u2019s throat for good measure, causing it to leak even more blood out onto the snow. You tie a thick rope around its neck and antlers, and then begin the difficult task of dragging it back to camp\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Return to camp", "result": "    You smell smoke long before you reach the camp. Without thinking of it, you drop the deer in the snow; if this is a false alarm, you can come back for it later. Then, you sprint off towards the camp.\n\n\n    Your intuition is correct. The camp is in ruins. Three out of the four communal tents have been razed to the ground, and the fourth is smouldering. Bodies litter the ground; killed indiscriminately. Women, children, infants, and a few men all lie in puddles of their own blood.\n\n\n    You see Tacitus lying spread-eagled in the snow. It would appear someone has taken pity on his recent misfortunes, and has taken it upon themselves to give him a bright-red smile, just below the chin.\n\n\n    Without thinking, you draw your bow and loose an arrow. The arrow embeds itself in the tower-shield of a legionnaire.\n\n\n    He shouts something in a language unbeknownst to you, summoning three of his comrades out from the burning tent; one is dragging a half-naked woman along with him.\n\n\n    He draws his shortsword and begins to charge towards you. You drop your bow in the sand, and withdraw your spear.\n\n\n    Your first thrust is deflected by the shortsword; he retaliates by pushing forward with his oversized shield, sending you scrambling through the snow. You narrowly dodge an overhead swipe from his blade.\n\n\n    Seizing an apparent opportunity, you leap to the left, and stab wildly at him with your spear; the blow strikes true, but your stone spear tip uselessly slides off his plated chest armour. You look on his face and see a cruel sneer.\n\n\n    With breathtaking speed, he dashes forward and kicks you square in the chest. The blow sends you reeling, and knocks the air clean out of your lungs. You try to regain your footing as he drops his shield and charges at you.\n\n\n     The two of you tumble to the snow. You fling your spear aside as you fall. He grabs your neck in one of his gauntleted hands, and begins to crush your throat in an iron grip.\n\n\n    Panic grips your world as you frantically look around for options. Your hand closes around your hunting knife. As black spots dance across your vision, you notice something; his armour only extends halfway up his arm, and the rest is covered merely by fur. You seize the initiative and shove the dagger into his exposed forearm. He curses as blood gushes out from the wound, and releases your neck.\n\n\n    You greedily inhale as much air as you can. The legionnaire punches you in the face, and his metal knuckles easily break your nose. Blood pours down your face and into your mouth. He punches you again, knocking a tooth down your mouth.\n\n\n    Time slows to a halt. His fists glance off your face, mangling it into a bloody ruin. You see your own clouds of hot breath seeping out into the air like a gushing wound. The legionnaires eyes narrow inside his helmet, and a cruel smile splits his face from end to end.\n\n\n    Before you\u2019re submerged in darkness, he speaks two words in your language:\n\n\n    \u201cElf scum.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Taken as a slave", "result": "    You can\u2019t stop throwing up.
