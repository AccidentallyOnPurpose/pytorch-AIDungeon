As they wing away you clutch Mondy to you, whispering, \u201cThank you,\u201d and kissing him passionately as the scarlet leaves overhead drift down onto his golden hair.\n\nThese last couple of years have been hell. The two of you had your love put to the test more than ever before. It\u2019s been utterly draining--physically, emotionally, financially--but as you look into Mondy\u2019s eyes you know it was all worthwhile, and you know he feels the same. Such a warm feeling of peace and joy suffuses you, and you can\u2019t help but kiss him again.\n\nDays drift by, careless and lazy.\n\nThe two of you spend the evenings fishing, and during the day you glean whatever you can find from the overgrown fields. Mondy is still in recovery from his long illness and a bit weak, so the bulk of the work falls on you. Not that you mind. The days are quiet and peaceful, and it\u2019s a joy just to be alive as you greet each sunrise, your love at your side.\n\nIt\u2019s really just the two of you out here now; there were only a handful left in the village after the sickness came, and since then they\u2019ve all packed up and left. No future out here. You heard those words often enough, even in your younger days, and there was even a time you believed it.\n\nAnd of course, there were uglier words.", "action_results": [{"action": "Days past", "result": "The first meeting with Mondy came while dropping off a necklace of your mother\u2019s. The clasp needed repairing, and he was still a jeweler\u2019s apprentice then. You\u2019d always been considered eccentric, and Mother had stopped bothering to ask you when her dear boy Mirk was going to find a nice girl and give her a grandchild long ago. You\u2019d expected you\u2019d die alone, and a virgin, if you were being completely honest with yourself. But when you met Mondy...there was a spark between the two of you immediately, and before long it lit a bonfire in your heart.\n\nThe two of you had never tried to hide your love.\n\nAt first, when you and Mondy pledged yourselves to one another under the tree on the hill, and then again in the village square, the others had been...accepting enough, even if a few of them clearly thought the both of you mad. But your mother had given you her blessing, and took Mondy into her heart almost as a second son, and that was the most important thing.\n\nNear the end, however, things changed. Personally, you blame the priest. Or perhaps it was the sickness weighing so heavily on everyone\u2019s souls that turned them twisted and cold. But the looks grew darker. The whispers grow uglier, and then stopped being whispers at all. They said the love you shared was an abomination. The priest stood in he doorway of the church and thundered that a demon had poisoned your mind.\n\nAny of that, all of that...you could have borne without complaint, and gone on about your life. Mondy\u2019s love was all you needed. But when your mother lay on her deathbed, and her last words were begging you to leave the man you loved? It broke something inside of you.\n\nAfter her funeral you and Mondy had a long talk...a long cry, really, on your part. There was never a question of you leaving him, of course. For your mother to even suggest it felt like a betrayal, though you knew she wasn\u2019t herself. She was weak, ill, just like Mondy had been, and being quite old and frail as well her mind had easily been poisoned against you.\n\nBut the two of you knew when you were no longer welcome, retreated from life in the village, and moved to a cottage on the other side of the hill. Eventually, the others all left. \u201cGood riddance to that lot,\u201d you\u2019d muttered to Mondy, watching the last cart being drawn away. \u201cWe can do as we like now.\u201d\n\n\nWhat would you like to do?", "action_results": [{"action": "Look around the cottage", "result": "The cottage--well, it\u2019s more like a shack--has seen better days.

It\u2019s early for a first frost, and you have a feeling this year may be a bad one.\n\nOpening the pantry, you find nothing but a cloud of dust that drives you into a coughing fit. Sneaking a guilty glance at where Mondy is resting on the bed, you relax when you see you haven\u2019t wakened him. He was sick for so long, on the verge of death, that even now he hasn\u2019t recovered his strength, and you worry constantly he\u2019ll have a relapse.\n\nThere\u2019s no firewood in the box. How long has it been since you\u2019ve replenished it? You really have been letting things slip around here. Perhaps it\u2019s time you start thinking more seriously about what you\u2019ll do in the coming days.

In the end, you were glad to see the last of them leave.
