But, she was still an amazing sight.\n\nYou had been snorkeling off the coast of your seclude island you live on, in taking the beauty of the multi colored fish and billowing sea plants. You see fish wandering over to a part of the ocean you hadn\u2019t snorkeled near before. Curious, you followed them and were shocked to find a girl lying unconscious on the ocean floor. You immediately plunge down and grab the girl, pulling her to the shore.\n\nYou didn\u2019t know much about CPR, with living alone on an island and all, but luckily you didn\u2019t need to. As soon as she reached the surface she started breathing. You carry her from the soft sand to your hut made out of sticks and palm leaves and you laid her on your couch. Years before you lived on the island you had packed up everything you owned in your house that didn\u2019t need electricity and basically moved to the seclude island. You were fed up with all the noise of the city and you decided you wanted to become a hermit\u2014with the basic comforts of modern day like a bed, couch, and other furniture.\n\nAs she lay on your couch, you were able to get a good look at her. Her brown hair was like a waterfall on her shoulders and she wore a silk blue satin dress that flowed on her legs like a mermaid tail. She obviously wasn\u2019t dressed for swimming. You thought that maybe she just fell overboard from a boat and the crash knocked her out. Though why she was so close to shore, you didn\u2019t know.\n\nHours later, she comes to. She opens her marble blue eyes and looks around, looking quite scared. She spots you and her eyes widen and she tenses up. You have to calm her down.\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Soothe like a mother", "result": "\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d you soothe, putting a hand on her shoulder.

You\u2019re safe now.\u201d She obviously has no idea what you are talking about. \u201cYou were underwater, and I pulled you up. Really, I\u2019m a good person.\u201d You scoot a little closer and she stands up abruptly and slips. You reach out to grab her as she falls and you catch her hand just before she hits the ground. You pull her up and she falls into your arms. She looks into your eyes and blushes, pushing you away. She crosses the room and sits down into a single wooden chair and looks away.

Every morning is the same routine--wake her up, eat a small breakfast, and try to get her to do something. Unfortunately, she never does anything but gaze out the window and watches the waves of the ocean.\n\nFinally the day comes when you are determined to make her smile.

Years ago a paint set washed up on shore along with a drenched canvas. You spent days trying to dry it well enough to use and slowly, but surely, it did and you spent even more days painting a beautiful masterpiece of the ocean shore that can be seen during the sunset with a couple of mermaids and wildlife swimming in the ocean.\n\nThe girl starts staring at the painting rather than through the window, day after day. You find yourself starting to watch her everyday as well, studying her features, adoring her body, and wondering so hard what her voice sounds like. You imagine every tone you can that could fit the beautiful body of the girl, but you can't decide which would fit her best.\n\nI don't even know her name, you realize. I have to get her to talk.

Even she can tell that her clothes are starting to stink, and swimming in the ocean won't help the smell. You hold up a long dress that once floated on shore. It seems to be much like one a woman would wear to the pool side or beach. Swimming in it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nWithin minutes she's changed into the dress and the two of you are walking down the sandy path to the main beach. The sun is beating down on the two of you and she is practically skipping towards the ocean. You smile to yourself as she almost laughs in joy at the fresh air after being stuck in your hut for over a month.\n\nAs soon as she reaches the beach, she sprints toward the cool waters of the ocean. She shrieks a little as the cold seawater splashes her, but giggles at the tickle of seaweed under her toes. You sit down on the sand and watch her as she wades around in the water. She occasionally will go underwater and a couple seconds later appear several yards away from where she was originally.\n\nYou are a tad worried about her, considering she was unconscious in the water when you found her.

You run into the water and to where she was moments ago.
